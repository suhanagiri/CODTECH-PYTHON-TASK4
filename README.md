ABOUT ME

Hi, I'm SUHANA GIRI, a motivated and tech-enthusiastic BCA student, currently in my 3rd year at Guru Kashi University. I have a passion for web development and creating user-focused digital experiences. This project is part of my internship task at CodeTech, where I demonstrated my skills in building a Spam Classifier.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project builds a **spam email classifier** using `scikit-learn` and `TfidfVectorizer`.

## üîç Features
- Loads labeled email data (spam/ham)
- Vectorizes text using TF-IDF
- Trains Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluates performance with precision, recall, F1-score
- Predicts custom inputs

üéØ Objective
Create a predictive classification model using scikit-learn.
We‚Äôll build a Spam Email Classifier that uses text features to predict if a message is "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## üìÅ Files Included
- `spam_classifier.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with all code and results
- `spam.csv` - Sample labeled dataset
- `requirements.txt` - Required libraries
- `spam_classifier_confusion_matrix.png` - Confusion Matrix of the spam classifier model
- `README.md` - Documentation

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
